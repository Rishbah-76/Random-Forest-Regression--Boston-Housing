# Random-Forest-Regression--Boston-Housing
Project Description üìÑ

‚ùÑÔ∏è Built a Random Forest Regressor model using scikit learn in boston data to predict 'Price' based on other dependent variable.

# Data:
    Number of Instances: 506

    Number of Attributes: 13 numeric/categorical predictive. Median Value (attribute 14) is usually the target.

    Attribute Information (in order):
        - CRIM     per capita crime rate by town
        - ZN       proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
        - INDUS    proportion of non-retail business acres per town
        - CHAS     Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
        - NOX      nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
        - RM       average number of rooms per dwelling
        - AGE      proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
        - DIS      weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
        - RAD      index of accessibility to radial highways
        - TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
        - PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town
        - B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
        - LSTAT    % lower status of the population

## Model Overview:
We are using the RandomForest as it provides low bias and low variance and can work better for a small dataset as well.
